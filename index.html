          <h2>Silicon Valley 3D Presents: All Things 3D Printing</h2>
          <p>
            3D printing is awesome… and exciting… and at least for the hobbyist, new.  As with all new tech, we are far from easy 
            plug-n-play, so we often need a little help from our friends.
            <a href="community.html">Bay Area Rep Rap</a> first assembled during the earliest days of 
            “<b>rep</b>etative <b>rap</b>id prototyping,”  
            aka 3D printing. Back then, we had to build our own 3D printers so these folks really know 
            the tech.  Now you can easily buy a 3D Printer for a reasonable price, making the 
            initiation process so much simpler for those who are just starting on a creative journey.
            </p><p> 
            Just like you, all of us had to start without knowing anything. The Bay Area Rep Rap group now has members 
            with all levels of experience and we are continually learning from each other or just having fun 
            seeing creative people at play… what do they make? How do they do it? Yes, we too have disasters 
            and have learned to laugh about it while educating others on what went wrong. Misprints happen. 
            We learn. We share. For now, this guide will point you to our favorite answers to common questions 
            we hear, to be replaced with more and more answers coming from our members as we build our knowledge base. 
            Take a look at our <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/bay-area-reprap" target="_blank"> Bay Area Rep Rap Discussion Group</a> 
            and even post your questions. Better yet, join us at our next Meetup!

          <h3>What is 3D printing?</h3>
          <p>
          At its most basic, an FDM 3D printer transforms a spool of plastic filament into a 3D object.  
          The filament passes through the Extruder, which grabs the filament and pushes it into 
          the Hot End, where the filament melts and under computer control, drops the molten plastic 
          into a precise location on the Build Plate. The Build Plate is the flat surface where your 
          model will appear. A fan cools the new layer of plastic into place. 
          </p><p>
          There is something magical about watching a 3D object emerge as the printer adds each new layer of plastic.
