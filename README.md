New 3d Printer User Info, Bay Area RepRap: CC-BY-SA-4.0

We (The folks in the Bay Area RepRap group) created this document to help the 
folks who come to the meetings, who just don’t know  where to start. There’s a 
lot of info available, but it’s not easily digestible. So hopefully these pages 
may serve as a starting place on your journey. This guide is geared toward the 
new 3d printer owner,  If you are interested in building one, come to the meetings, 
there are lots of folks there with experience, happy to share.

I'll be posting this up on a website soon.
